Welcome! This blog will cover **Economics**, **Chess**, **Machine Learning**, and occasional reflections on a host of other topics that interest me. Economics, Chess and ML
are broadly the topics that I find most interesting currently, but that's very much subject to change.

## Why I'm Writing

I've lately been feeling the urge to write, so I'm carving out time to put my thoughts down. Hopefully, this habit will last a while. I'm aiming to achieve a few things through this blog:

1.  **Thinking harder and deeper**: Get back into learning and thinking harder about a topic
2.  **Leverage AI**: Use this as an opportunity to get better at using AI tools for coding, research and writing.
3.  **Digital Minimalism**: Divert attention from doomscrolling to something more productive and cathartic.
