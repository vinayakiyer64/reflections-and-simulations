I’m aiming to achieve a few things through this blog:\n\nThinking harder and deeper: Get back into learning and thinking harder about a topic\nLeverage AI: Use this as an opportunity to get better at using AI tools for coding, research and writing.\nDigital Minimalism: Divert attention from doomscrolling to something more productive and cathartic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis blog is built with Quarto, which allows me to mix code, prose, and math seamlessly."
